Add one or more console logs here to help with debugging. The logs should be of the general format:

console.log('<EMOJI FLAG> [<FUNCTION NAME>] <LOGIC SUMMARY>', <DEBUG OBJECT>);

where the sections are described below:

- EMOJI FLAG: this should be a 1-3 character random sequence of colorful emoji characters to disambiguate this log from other logs on the console. you can use any sequence, but this list is a good place to start. repeated emojis and patterns make it easier to parse the logs, but it's important that this emoji sequence look different from other sequences in the codebase, including in this file. the list: 🟩🟥🟧🟨🟫🟦🟪⬛⬜🟡🟢🟠🔴🔵🟤⚪⭕🟣⚫Ⓜ️
- FUNCTION NAME: this should be the name of the function that is being logged.
- LOGIC SUMMARY: this should be a short summary of the logic that is being executed. keep this very brief, easy to read, and memorable.
- DEBUG OBJECT: this should be an object that contains the variables that are most relevant and useful for introspection into what the code is doing.

some example console logs of the correct format:

console.log('🟧🟩 [generateDerivationConfig] initializing array for derivation config', {
  query,
  prompt,
  configArray,
  userId: id,
  blocks,
});

console.log('🟨🟥 [parseAsBoolean] AI block is done parsing boolean', { value, debug });

console.log('🔵🟪 [calculateClientBlock] CACHE MISS', { block, scope, calculatedBlockCache });

DO NOT USE THE SAME EMOJI FLAG AS ANY OTHER LOGS.
