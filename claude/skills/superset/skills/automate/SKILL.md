name: automate
description: Turn a recurring chore into a Superset automation — drafts the agent prompt, confirms schedule and target, creates it with the CLI, and reviews the first run together. Use when the user wants a scheduled or recurring agent, a daily/weekly job, or to automate a repeating task with Superset.
argument-hint: describe the recurring task

# Superset Automate

Turn "I keep doing X every morning" into an automation that does X on a schedule.

## 1. Understand the chore

Pin down: the outcome, the cadence, the inputs it reads, and what "done" looks like. Then draft the automation prompt — write it as instructions for an agent with zero context, and if the task has rules that will evolve (triage criteria, formats), put them in a document the automation reads at runtime so they can be edited without touching the prompt.

## 2. Pick the target

- `superset projects list` — a project target creates a fresh workspace per run (most tasks)
- `superset workspaces list` — a workspace target reuses the same workspace every run (stateful tasks)

## 3. Confirm before creating

Show the user (use the ask_user tool if available): the name, the schedule as an RRULE, the agent, and the target — plus the exact command you will run. Never create without explicit confirmation.

## 4. Create and shake down

```bash
superset automations create \
  --name "Daily issue triage" \
  --rrule "FREQ=DAILY;BYHOUR=9;BYMINUTE=0" \
  --timezone America/Los_Angeles \
  --project <id> \
  --agent claude \
  --prompt-file /tmp/automation-prompt.md
```

(`--workspace <id>` instead of `--project` for reuse mode; `--host <id>` if it should run on another machine; prefer `--prompt-file` for multiline prompts.)

Then trigger a first run now with `superset automations run <id>`, review `superset automations logs <id>` with the user, and refine the prompt via `superset automations prompt set <id>` until the run output is right. An automation isn't done until one real run looked good.
